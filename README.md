# AdaBoost_And_RandomForest


In this repository, I want to provide you with an example of applying ensemble learning in machine learning using the AdaBoost and RandomForest algorithms. In this tutorial, I will demonstrate how to use AdaBoost and RandomForest in Python, and for this purpose, I am using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset as my experimental data. feel free to fork or download this repository for your project or learn the basic of the AdaBoost 
and RandomForest implementaion in python.
